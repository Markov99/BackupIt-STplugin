 ̶B̶u̶g̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶s̶o̶l̶v̶e̶  Features:
1. You can create "\.backups\YourFile.Extension\" directory by hand and it still will work.
2. You can create a new file, switch tab to another file and save it: it will trigger context menu to appear.
If you press "Yes" it will backing up this file instead of that was created. Then if you save that new file,
context menu will not appear and file will not backing up.
Probably it is an easier way to start backing up already existing file.
